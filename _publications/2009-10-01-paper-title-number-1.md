title: "The Prospect of ‘Just Emissions’ as an International Norm of Environmental Governance"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /_publications/Just_Emissions
excerpt: "So-called “luxury emissions” of Global North countries need to be curtailed in line with, and also more rapidly than, the increase in emissions from Global South nations. I argue there is a growing need for radical social austerity and climate conservatism on the part of large emitters."
