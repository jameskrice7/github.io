title: "An Ecological Ethics for the Anthropocene: Environmental Justice and Religion"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /_publications/Conf_paper
excerpt: 'This essay examines the relationship between critical theological theories within
avant-garde scholarship on religion as a social phenomenon and the equally, if not
more, pressing revelations of climate scientists regarding the ecological crisis
which is partly the result of a society whose faith has been misplaced in a form of
unsustainable technology which threatens to destroy us.'
